This project focuses on displaying alphanumeric messages using a 4-digit 7-segment display. The system is fully implemented in assembly language, managing the multiplexing of digits and character encoding to efficiently present information on limited hardware resources.

This type of project is valuable for understanding low-level programming and timing control in embedded systems. Similar techniques are widely used in digital clocks, basic calculators, measurement devices, and any system that requires compact numerical or text output.
