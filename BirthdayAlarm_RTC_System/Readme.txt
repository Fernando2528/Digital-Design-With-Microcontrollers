This project implements a Birthday Alarm System for ATmega328P (Arduino Uno/Nano) using avr-gcc compiler. It features a real-time clock (DS1307 RTC via I2C), buzzer melody output on PD2, and UART serial menu interface. The system continuously monitors the current date against a stored birthday in EEPROM, automatically calculates age, and plays the "Happy Birthday" melody exactly on the birth date.

This design combines RTC timekeeping, persistent data storage, and audio generation for event-based systems. Applications include personalized reminder devices, event notification systems, holiday alert modules, medication schedulers, or any embedded system requiring date-specific audio/visual alerts with user-configurable timing.
