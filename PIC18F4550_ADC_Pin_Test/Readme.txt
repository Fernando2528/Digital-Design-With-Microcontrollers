This project tests the functionality of an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) pin on the PIC18F4550 microcontroller, programmed using the XC8 compiler. It demonstrates ADC configuration, channel selection, sampling, conversion triggering, and result reading with basic output visualization.

ADC testing is fundamental for analog sensor interfacing in embedded systems. This code serves as a starting point for applications like temperature monitoring, light intensity measurement, battery voltage monitoring, potentiometer-based user interfaces, and any project requiring analog signal digitization.
